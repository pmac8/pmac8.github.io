        <h3>HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO SEE THE ZOO?</h3>
        <p>With 265 acres of wildlife habitats and attractions, it's difficult to see the entire zoo in one day. For shorter visits, take a two-hour tour of our most popular exhibits, like Moose Mountain, Himalayan Highlands, Moose Forest, and World of Moose. During the warmer months, guests with young children can begin their visit at the Kitten's Zoo and then stroll Astor Court to meet our kitties and visit Madagascar! In wintertime, warm up in JungleWorld, our giant indoor rainforest habitat.</p>
        
        <h3>IS THERE A DAY WHEN ADMISSION IS FREE?</h3>
        <p>General admission is free all day on Wednesdays at the Moose Zoo. Please consider making a donation to help support our operating costs, and to aid our work in caring for animals here in New York and around the world. We appreciate your support!</p>
        
        <h3>DO I GET IN FREE IF I'M A MEMBER OF ANOTHER ZOO?</h3>
        <p>WCS does not honor reciprocal memberships from other zoos. However, by becoming a WCS member, you can enjoy free admission to all four of our New York Zoos and the Aquarium. Find out more about the benefits of membership!</p>
