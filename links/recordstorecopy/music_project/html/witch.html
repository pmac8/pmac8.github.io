            <p class="about">Widely seen as the most popular Zambian band of the 1970s, Witch (an acronym for 'We Intend to Cause Havoc') were formed during Zambia's golden post-independence days, and were headed by Emanuel "Jagari" Chanda</p>

            <p class="about">With the economy collapsing in the late-1970s, and increasing government authoritarianism, Witch, like most Zamrock bands, were reduced to playing daytime shows to avoid the curfews, and faded away. As of 2013, Jagari is touring again.</p>
