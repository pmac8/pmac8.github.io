            <p class="about">Strangeways, Here We Come is the fourth and final studio album by English rock band the Smiths. Released on 28 September 1987 (several months after their disbandment) by Rough Trade Records, it reached number two on the UK Albums Chart, staying in the chart for 17 weeks. All of the songs were composed by Johnny Marr, with lyrics written and sung by Morrissey. The album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry on 1 October 1987 and also by the Recording Industry Association of America on 19 September 1990.</p>

            <p class="about">Slant Magazine listed the album at No. 69 on its list of "Best Albums of the 1980s", writing that "Whether or not Strangeways, Here We Come ended the Smiths' brief career with their best album has been the subject of considerable debate for nearly a quarter century, but it definitively stands as the band's most lush, richest work."</p>
